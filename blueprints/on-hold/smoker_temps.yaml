# Smoker blueprint for notifications and the like


## Reset temp sensors when smoker off/unavailable
### actual temp sensors = 0F, otherwise may continually keep alerting that temp is reached

## Alert for the following: Can probably use sensor.smoker_probe_x_status
### Grill reaches target temperature
### Probe A is approaching target temperature
### Probe A has reached target temperature
### Probe A is overcooked!!!
### Probe B is approaching target temperature
### Probe B has reached target temperature
### Probe B is overcooked

### May not be a bad idea to alert when smoker is first turned on



##### NOTIFICATIONS #####
# should send to appropriate targets. Doing this right likely means reworking notifications entirely
